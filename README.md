This is a self-contained, well-documented Python implementation for composing an operator graph (a directed acyclic graph of differentiable operators). It includes:

Operator base class (forward & optional backward)

Concrete operators (Input, Add, Mul, Linear, ReLU)

OperatorGraph for connecting operators, topological sort, forward execution, optional simple backward pass

Small usage example and simple DOT output for visualization

Copy-paste and run â€” no external dependencies required.


# OperatorGraph
What this gives you

A tiny framework for building operator graphs (DAGs).

Forward execution with dependency resolution (topological sort).

A scalar backward pass (toy example) to get gradients for parameters/inputs.

Easy to extend: implement new Operator subclasses (e.g., Sigmoid, MatMul for vectors/matrices, batch ops) and override forward/backward.

# Suggestions / next steps (pick any)

Vectorize operators to support NumPy arrays (replace scalars with numpy.ndarray and implement proper broadcasting).

Add automatic parameter nodes (mark some nodes as trainable parameters).

Add caching, shape/ type checks, and better error messages.

Integrate with visualization libraries (Graphviz) to render the DOT string.
